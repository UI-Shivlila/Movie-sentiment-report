**Choice Of Dataset:**
The choice of this dataset is based on its sentiment analysis, containing labeled text data associated with sentiment labels.
Understanding sentiments expressed in movie reviewshave practical applications, such as gauging audience reactions and improving movie recommendations.

**Challenges Faced:**

Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization, lemmatization, and handling stopwords required careful consideration. The NLTK library was used for text preprocessing, and missing resources like 'punkt' and 
'wordnet' needed to be downloaded.

Model Configuration:

Selecting appropriate parameters for the LSTM layer, such as the number of units, dropout rates, and optimization algorithm, required experimentation and tuning.


**Model Evaluation**
Logistic Regression:   86.4% accuracy
MultinomialNB:   83.8% accuracy
LSTM Model:   84% accuracy
